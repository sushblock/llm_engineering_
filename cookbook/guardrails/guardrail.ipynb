Purpose &amp; Scope\\n- Capture detailed, actionable product feedback from users.\\n- Ensure all feedback is logged centrally for product‑team review and roadmap planning.\\n- Consistently acknowledge every customer, even if the inquiry will not result in an immediate product change.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. General Workflow Overview\\n\\n```\\nStep 1 – Identify type of feedback\\n        |\\nStep 2 – Gather details &amp; confirmations\\n        |\\nStep 3 – Log &amp; route in Feedback System\\n        |\\nStep 4 – Acknowledge customer &amp; give timeline\\n        |\\nStep 5 – Close ticket or transition to next agent\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Step‑by‑step Instructions\\n\\n| **Step** | **Action** | **Details &amp; Decision Points** |\\n|---|---|---|\\n| 1 | **Open a New Feedback Ticket** | Use the \"Feedback\" form in the CRM. Enter: \\n• Ticket ID \\n• Customer name and contact \\n• Order # (if applicable) \\n• Product SKU |\\n| 2 | **Determine Feedback Type** | Ask the question: \\n• \"How can we help you today?\" \\nAfter the initial response classify as:\\n• **Positive** (praise, compliments)\\n• **Negative** (complaints, bugs, usability issues)\\n• **Feature Request / Improvement**\\n• **Other** (General inquiries that don’t fit above) |\\n| 3 | **Capture Key Information** | Use the template below; ensure each required field is filled. |\\n| 3a | **If Positive** | • What particularly did you enjoy?\\n• Would you recommend this product to others? (Yes/No)\\n• Any visual evidence (screenshots, video) you’d like to share? |\\n| 3b | **If Negative** | &lt;details&gt; &lt;summary&gt;Below are mandatory sub‑steps&lt;/summary&gt; &lt;p&gt;• Ask the user to **describe the issue in detail** (why it happened, where, how often).\\n• Ask for a **visual example** (screenshot or video).\\n• Record the **severity**: (Critical / High / Medium / Low).\\n• Ask if the user wants a **resolution** (refund, replacement, workaround, or simply feedback?).\\n• If the issue qualifies for a **return** (damaged, defect, satisfaction), hand off per the Return Policy. If not, proceed with this feedback flow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; |\\n| 3c | **If Feature Request / Improvement** | • Ask for the **exact feature** (or improvement) requested.\\n• Ask for the **benefit** it would bring to the user or business.\\n• Record **priority** (User‑request / High Impact / Low Impact). |\\n| 3d | **If Other** | Capture open‑ended notes. Tag \"Other\" for later triage. |\\n| 4 | **Log Feedback** | Enter collected details into the **Product Feedback System** (e.g., Jira, Asana, or the in‑house \"Feedback Tracker\"). \\n• Use predefined labels: Positive / Negative / Feature Request / Other.\\n• Attach any screenshots or media.\\n• Add a **customer sentiment score** (1–5) if possible. |\\n| 5 | **Route to Appropriate Team** | • Positive/Negative → **Customer Success &amp; Support Team** (for immediate resolution or escalation).\\n• Feature requests → **Product Management** for backlog review.\\n• \"Other\" issues → **Product Ops** for possible cross‑function review. |\\n| 6 | **Acknowledge the Customer** | &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Template for acknowledgment:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;\"Thank you for sharing your feedback on &lt;strong&gt;[Product Name]&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;We’ve logged your comments and they’re now in the product team’s review queue. We’ll keep you updated if we need more information, and you’ll hear back on next steps within &lt;strong&gt;5 business days&lt;/strong&gt;.\"\\n&lt;/p&gt; |\\n| 7 | **Set a Review SLA** | • For **Feature Requests**: First triage within **3 business days**.\\n• For **Negative Feedback** (not qualifying for a return): Resolution discussion within **5 business days**. |\\n| 8 | **Close Ticket / Transition** | • If no further questions from the customer, close the ticket.\\n• If follow‑up is needed from the product team, create an internal task and **document the expected completion date** in the ticket notes.\\n• Send a **“We appreciate your input”** email after the review cycle. |\\n---\\n\\n### 4.

Information Security &amp; Compliance\\n\\n- **Customer Data**: Never share personal data outside the CRM or feedback system without explicit customer consent.\\n- **Data Retention**: Keep all feedback logs for **365 days** for audit purposes.\\n- **GDPR / CCPA**: Provide a privacy notice for any request to view or delete their captured feedback.\\n---\\n\\n### 6. KPIs &amp; Reporting\\n\\n| **Metric** | **Target** | **Cadence** |\\n|---|---|---|\\n| Avg. acknowledgement time | &lt; 24 hrs | Weekly |\\n| % of feedback logged within SLA | ≥ 95% | Monthly |\\n| % of feature requests promoted to backlog | ≥ 70% | Quarterly |\\n| Customer satisfaction (post‑feedback) | ≥ 90% | Quarterly Surveys |\\n---\\n\\n### 7. Sample Feedback Form Template (Use in CRM)\\n\\n| Field | Value | Notes |\\n|---|---|---|\\n| Customer Name |  |  |\\n| Contact |  |  |\\n| Order # / SKU |  |  |\\n| Feedback Type | Positive / Negative / Feature Request / Other |  |\\n| Description |  |  |\\n| Severity (if negative) | Critical / High / Medium / Low |  |\\n| Requesting Resolution? | Yes / No | Only if negative |\\n| Attachment(s) |  |  |\\n| Sentiment Score | 1–5 |  |\\n| Initial TL;DR |  | Short summary for internal use |\\n---\\n\\n### 8. Example Agent Dialogue Scripts\\n\\n**Positive Feedback**\\n&gt; Agent: \"Thanks for your kind words about [Product]! What specific features did you love? Would you like to share a photo?\"\\n\\n**Negative Feedback / Bug**\\n&gt; Agent: \"I’m sorry you’re experiencing this issue. Could you describe what happened and attach a screenshot? That will help our engineering team troubleshoot.\"\\n\\n**Feature Request**\\n&gt; Agent: \"That’s an interesting idea! Which part of the user journey would benefit most? Your input will be sent to product for review.\"\\n\\n**Return‑related Negative Feedback**\\n&gt; Agent: \"I hear you. Let me first check our return policy to see if you’re eligible for a refund or replacement. Please hold on for 2 minutes.\"\\n---\\n\\n### 9. Escalation Path\\n\\n1. **Tier 1 Agent** – Log feedback, ask clarifying questions.\\n2. **Tier 2 Agent** – Provide feedback in product or engineering backlog; request additional info if needed.\\n3. **Product Manager** – Review request, add to roadmap if appropriate.\\n4. **Executive (in rare cases)** – For high‑impact or high‑volume feature requests that may alter company strategy.\\n---\\n\\n**End of Product Feedback Policy**\\nAdhere to these steps to ensure consistent, actionable product insight while delivering a professional customer experience.</td>\n",

    "When building out our hallucination guardrail, here are some guiding principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "A) Provide very descriptive metrics to evaluate whether a response is accurate\n",
    "It is important to break down this idea of \"truth\" in easily identifiable metrics that we can measure\n",
    "Metrics like truthfulness and relevance are difficult to measure. Giving concrete ways to score the statement can result in a more accurate guardrail\n",
    "B) Ensure consistency across key terminology\n",
    "It is important to keep relevant terms such as knowledge base articles, assistants, and users consistent across the prompt\n",
    "If we begin to use phrases such as assistant vs agent, the model could get confused\n",
    "C) Start with the most advanced model\n",
    "There is a cost vs quality trade-off when using the most advanced models. Although GPT-4o may be more expensive, it is important to start with the most advanced model so we can ensure a high degree of accuracy\n",
    "Once we have thoroughly tested out the guardrail and are confident in its performance, we can look to reducing cost by tuning it down to gpt-3.5-turbo\n",
    "D) Evaluate each sentence independently and the entire response as a whole\n",
    "If the agent returns a long response, it can be useful to break down the response to individual sentences and evaluate them independently\n",
    "In addition to that, evaluating the whole intent of the message as a whole can ensure that you don't lose important context\n",
    "\n",
    "With all of this in mind, let's build out a guardrail system and measure its performance."
