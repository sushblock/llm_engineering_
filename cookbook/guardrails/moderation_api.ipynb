    "Moderation, much like guardrails in the physical world, serves as a preventative measure to ensure that your application remains within the bounds of acceptable and safe content. Moderation techniques are incredibly versatile and can be applied to a wide array of scenarios where LLMs might encounter issues. This notebook is designed to offer straightforward examples that can be adapted to suit your specific needs, while also discussing the considerations and trade-offs involved in deciding whether to implement moderation and how to go about it. This notebook will use our Moderation API (https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation/overview), a tool you can use to check whether text or an image is potentially harmful.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will concentrate on:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Input Moderation: Identifying and flagging inappropriate or harmful content before it is processed by your LLM.\n",
    "2. Output Moderation: Reviewing and validating the content generated by your LLM before it reaches the end user.\n",
    "3. Custom Moderation: Tailoring moderation criteria and rules to suit the specific needs and context of your application, ensuring a personalized and effective content control mechanism."

    "1. Input moderation\n",
    "\n",
    "Input Moderation focuses on preventing harmful or inappropriate content from reaching the LLM, with common applications including:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (i) Content Filtering: Prevent the spread of harmful content such as hate speech, harassment, explicit material, and misinformation on social media, forums, and content creation platforms.\n",
    "    (ii) Community Standards Enforcement: Ensure that user interactions, such as comments, forum posts, and chat messages, adhere to the community guidelines and standards of online platforms, including educational environments, gaming communities, or dating apps.\n",
    "    (iii) Spam and Fraud Prevention: Filter out spam, fraudulent content, and misleading information in online forums, comment sections, e-commerce platforms, and customer reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "These measures act as preventive controls, operating before or alongside the LLM to alter your application's behavior if specific criteria are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "Embrace async\n",
    "\n",
    "A common design to minimize latency is to send your moderations asynchronously along with your main LLM call. If your moderation gets triggered you send back a placeholder response, otherwise send back the LLM response. This pattern can also be found in our Guardrails Cookbook. It's important to note that while the async mode is effective in minimizing latency, it can also lead to unnecessary costs. Specifically, you could avoid completion costs if the content is flagged before processing. Therefore, it's crucial to balance the benefits of reduced latency with the potential for increased expenses when using async mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use this approach, creating an execute_chat_with_moderation function that will run our LLM's get_chat_response and the check_expression moderation function in parallel, and return the LLM response only if the moderation returns False (not triggered).\n",
    "\n",
    "Workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create a workflow that incorporates the Moderation API to check user input for any potentially unsafe content before it is sent to the Language Model (LLM). This ensures that only appropriate content is processed further in the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Receive an input from the user\n",
    "2. Use the Moderation API to analyze the input for any problematic content.\n",
    "3. Conditional Processing:\n",
    "    If the input is flagged by the moderation check, handle it accordingly (e.g., reject the input, ask the user to rephrase, etc.).\n",
    "    If the input is not flagged, pass it to the LLM for further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will demonstrate this workflow with two example prompts. One for text and another for image. Note that you can pass both the text and the image in the same request."

    "2. Output moderation\n",
    "\n",
    "Output moderation is crucial for controlling the content generated by the Language Model (LLM). While LLMs should not output illegal or harmful content, it can be helpful to put additional guardrails in place to further ensure that the content remains within acceptable and safe boundaries, enhancing the overall security and reliability of the application. Common types of output moderation include:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (i) Content Quality Assurance: Ensure that generated content, such as articles, product descriptions, and educational materials, is accurate, informative, and free from inappropriate information.\n",
    "    (ii) Community Standards Compliance: Maintain a respectful and safe environment in online forums, discussion boards, and gaming communities by filtering out hate speech, harassment, and other harmful content.\n",
    "    (iii) User Experience Enhancement: Improve the user experience in chatbots and automated services by providing responses that are polite, relevant, and free from any unsuitable language or content.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all these scenarios, output moderation plays a crucial role in maintaining the quality and integrity of the content generated by language models, ensuring that it meets the standards and expectations of the platform and its users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting moderation thresholds\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI has selected thresholds for moderation categories that balance precision and recall for our use cases, but your use case or tolerance for moderation may be different. Setting this threshold is a common area for optimization - we recommend building an evaluation set and grading the results using a confusion matrix to set the right tolerance for your moderation. The trade-off here is generally:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (i) More false positives leads to a fractured user experience, where customers get annoyed and the assistant seems less helpful.\n",
    "    (iii) More false negatives can cause lasting harm to your business, as people get the assistant to answer inappropriate questions, or provide inappropriate responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, on a platform dedicated to creative writing, the moderation threshold for certain sensitive topics might be set higher to allow for greater creative freedom while still providing a safety net to catch content that is clearly beyond the bounds of acceptable expression. The trade-off is that some content that might be considered inappropriate in other contexts is allowed, but this is deemed acceptable given the platform's purpose and audience expectations.\n",

    "    If the response is flagged by the moderation check, handle it accordingly (e.g., reject the response, show a placeholder message, etc.).\n",

    "Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this notebook has explored the essential role of moderation in applications powered by language models (LLMs). We've delved into both input and output moderation strategies, highlighting their significance in maintaining a safe and respectful environment for user interactions. Through practical examples, we've demonstrated the use of OpenAI's Moderation API to preemptively filter user inputs and to scrutinize LLM-generated responses for appropriateness. The implementation of these moderation techniques is crucial for upholding the integrity of your application and ensuring a positive experience for your users.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you further develop your application, consider the ongoing refinement of your moderation strategies through custom moderations. This may involve tailoring moderation criteria to your specific use case or integrating a combination of machine learning models and rule-based systems for a more nuanced analysis of content. Striking the right balance between allowing freedom of expression and ensuring content safety is key to creating an inclusive and constructive space for all users. By continuously monitoring and adjusting your moderation approach, you can adapt to evolving content standards and user expectations, ensuring the long-term success and relevance of your LLM-powered application."
