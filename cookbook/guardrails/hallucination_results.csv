## 1.  Opening the Warranty Inquiry

| Step | Action | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **1.1** |  Greet the customer and ask the main reason for the warranty call or ticket. | Use a friendly tone: “I’m sorry you’re having trouble. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?” |
| **1.2** | Log the ticket number and customer’s contact details in the CRM. | Ensure GDPR/HIPAA compliance if relevant. |
| **1.3** | Request the original order number, purchase date, and the name of the retailer (if not our own storefront). | This lets us pull the purchase record in the next step. |

---

## 2.  Verify Warranty Eligibility

| Step | Action | Decision Rules |
|------|--------|----------------|
| **2.1** | Pull the purchase record from our sales system. | • If status is “Returned” or “Disputed,” proceed to **2.3**. <br>• If record missing, ask the customer where they purchased the item. |
| **2.2** | Check “Warranty Period” and “Coverage Type” in the order history. | • Standard warranty: 12 months from purchase. <br>• Special coverage (e‑core warranty, extended warranty, etc.) may have different durations. |
| **2.3** | Verify that the product is a genuine SKU and not a counterfeit or off‑market version. | If the SKU is not in our database, inform the customer that we cannot honor a warranty claim. |
| **2.4** | Confirm the defect does not fall outside warranty coverage (e.g. accidental damage, misuse, power surges beyond tolerances). | If it is outside coverage, politely explain and offer paid repair if available. |

**Outcome:**  
- **Eligible** → move to step 3.  
- **Not Eligible** → close the ticket with a friendly explanation and offer any available paid repair/maintenance options.

---

## 3.  Gather Evidence & Documentation

| Step | Action | Requirements |
|------|--------|--------------|
| **3.1** | Ask the customer to upload photos or videos of the defect. | Images should show: <br>• The affected part(s) <br>• Any visible damage or malfunction. |
| **3.2** | If the product includes software, request the latest firmware version and logs if applicable. | Use the “Log upload” feature or provide a secure link. |
| **3.3** | Check that the evidence was captured within 24 hours of complaint. | If not, request the best available evidence and proceed, noting the delay in the ticket. |

**Decision:**  
- **Clear evidence of a manufacturing defect** → proceed to step 4.  
- **Unclear or insufficient evidence** → ask the customer to send additional photos or offer a troubleshooting session with the field support engineer.

---

## 4.  Determine Remedy

| Step | Action | What to do |
|------|--------|------------|
| **4.1** | Identify the remedy type: <br>• **Repair** – in‑house or authorized service center. <br>• **Replacement** – new unit shipped. <br>• **Refund** – if repair or replacement not feasible. | Use the “Remedy Matrix” in the policy manual. |
| **4.2** | Ask the customer which remedy they prefer (subject to availability and policy). | If the customer wants a replacement but a repair is quicker, explain the time difference and ask for consent. |
| **4.3** | Confirm the customer’s shipping address and preferred contact times. | Triple‑check for errors; a wrong address will delay the process. |

**Decision Logic:**
- **Replacement** if: <br>• The defect is in a critical part that cannot be reliably repaired <br>• The unit is out of the factory fault range.  
- **Repair** if: <br>• The defect is in a minor component <br>• The replacement stock is limited or unavailable.  
- **Refund** if: <br>• The unit is heavily damaged or beyond repair <br>• The customer prefers a return of money over a new unit.

---

## 5.  Process the Remedy

| Step | Action | Detail |
|------|--------|--------|
| **5.1** | Generate a pre‑paid return label. | Use the carrier portal; attach the label to the shipment. |
| **5.2** | Send the customer an email with: <br>• Return instructions (pick‑up, drop‑off, packaging). <br>• Expected turnaround time for repair or replacement. <br>• Contact number for follow‑up. | Include a printable return label if the carrier does not auto‑generate. |
| **5.3** | Receive the return: Once in our facility, log the arrival and start the repair or replacement. | Use the “Quality Assurance” workflow to validate defect. |
| **5.4** | Post‑repair or post‑replacement, test the unit and sign off in the system. | Update the ticket status to “Closed – Fulfilled.” |
| **5.5** | For refunds: Issue the refund through the original payment method. | Confirm the refund amount and time‑frame (usually 3‑7 business days). |

---

## 6.  Follow‑Up & Closing

| Step | Action | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **6.1** | Once the remedy is delivered, send a follow‑up email/ SMS: “Your replacement unit has arrived; please confirm you’re satisfied.” | Offer a short satisfaction survey if possible. |
| **6.2** | If any issues arise (e.g., new defect), log a new ticket and go back to step 1. | Use the same remedy flow. |
| **6.3** | Final ticket closure: | • Record the outcome. <br>• Tag the ticket with “Warranty – [remedy type]”. <br>• Send a friendly thank‑you note to the customer. |

---

## 7.  Special Cases & Escalations

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| **Product purchased abroad** | Verify tax and customs regulations; apply cross‑border warranty if applicable. |
| **Out‑of‑stock replacement** | Offer a repair with a reasonable ETA, or a refund if the repair cannot proceed within 30 days. |
| **Accidental damage** | Outside standard warranty; offer paid repair or replacement at a discounted rate. |
| **High‑value items (>$5,000)** | Escalate to the Warranty Manager for an SLA review. |
| **Disputed responsibility (user vs. manufacturer)** | Route to a senior field engineer for a technical review. |

---

| **2.2** | Check “Warranty Period” and “Coverage Type” in the order history. | • Standard warranty: 12 months from purchase. <br>• Special coverage (e‑core warranty, extended warranty, etc.) may have different durations. |
| **2.3** | Verify that the product is a genuine SKU and not a counterfeit or off‑market version. | If the SKU is not in our database, inform the customer that we cannot honor a warranty claim. |
| **2.4** | Confirm the defect does not fall outside warranty coverage (e.g. accidental damage, misuse, power surges beyond tolerances). | If it is outside coverage, politely explain and offer paid repair if available. |

**Outcome:**  
- **Eligible** → move to step 3.  
- **Not Eligible** → close the ticket with a friendly explanation and offer any available paid repair/maintenance options.

---

## 3.  Gather Evidence & Documentation

| Step | Action | Requirements |
|------|--------|--------------|
| **3.1** | Ask the customer to upload photos or videos of the defect. | Images should show: <br>• The affected part(s) <br>• Any visible damage or malfunction. |
| **3.2** | If the product includes software, request the latest firmware version and logs if applicable. | Use the “Log upload” feature or provide a secure link. |
| **3.3** | Check that the evidence was captured within 24 hours of complaint. | If not, request the best available evidence and proceed, noting the delay in the ticket. |

**Decision:**  
- **Clear evidence of a manufacturing defect** → proceed to step 4.  
- **Unclear or insufficient evidence** → ask the customer to send additional photos or offer a troubleshooting session with the field support engineer.

---

## 4.  Determine Remedy

| Step | Action | What to do |
|------|--------|------------|
| **4.1** | Identify the remedy type: <br>• **Repair** – in‑house or authorized service center. <br>• **Replacement** – new unit shipped. <br>• **Refund** – if repair or replacement not feasible. | Use the “Remedy Matrix” in the policy manual. |
| **4.2** | Ask the customer which remedy they prefer (subject to availability and policy). | If the customer wants a replacement but a repair is quicker, explain the time difference and ask for consent. |
| **4.3** | Confirm the customer’s shipping address and preferred contact times. | Triple‑check for errors; a wrong address will delay the process. |

**Decision Logic:**
- **Replacement** if: <br>• The defect is in a critical part that cannot be reliably repaired <br>• The unit is out of the factory fault range.  
- **Repair** if: <br>• The defect is in a minor component <br>• The replacement stock is limited or unavailable.  
- **Refund** if: <br>• The unit is heavily damaged or beyond repair <br>• The customer prefers a return of money over a new unit.

---

## 5.  Process the Remedy

| Step | Action | Detail |
|------|--------|--------|
| **5.1** | Generate a pre‑paid return label. | Use the carrier portal; attach the label to the shipment. |
| **5.2** | Send the customer an email with: <br>• Return instructions (pick‑up, drop‑off, packaging). <br>• Expected turnaround time for repair or replacement. <br>• Contact number for follow‑up. | Include a printable return label if the carrier does not auto‑generate. |
| **5.3** | Receive the return: Once in our facility, log the arrival and start the repair or replacement. | Use the “Quality Assurance” workflow to validate defect. |
| **5.4** | Post‑repair or post‑replacement, test the unit and sign off in the system. | Update the ticket status to “Closed – Fulfilled.” |
| **5.5** | For refunds: Issue the refund through the original payment method. | Confirm the refund amount and time‑frame (usually 3‑7 business days). |

---

## 6.  Follow‑Up & Closing

| Step | Action | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **6.1** | Once the remedy is delivered, send a follow‑up email/ SMS: “Your replacement unit has arrived; please confirm you’re satisfied.” | Offer a short satisfaction survey if possible. |
| **6.2** | If any issues arise (e.g., new defect), log a new ticket and go back to step 1. | Use the same remedy flow. |
| **6.3** | Final ticket closure: | • Record the outcome. <br>• Tag the ticket with “Warranty – [remedy type]”. <br>• Send a friendly thank‑you note to the customer. |

---

## 7.  Special Cases & Escalations

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| **Product purchased abroad** | Verify tax and customs regulations; apply cross‑border warranty if applicable. |
| **Out‑of‑stock replacement** | Offer a repair with a reasonable ETA, or a refund if the repair cannot proceed within 30 days. |
| **Accidental damage** | Outside standard warranty; offer paid repair or replacement at a discounted rate. |
| **High‑value items (>$5,000)** | Escalate to the Warranty Manager for an SLA review. |
| **Disputed responsibility (user vs. manufacturer)** | Route to a senior field engineer for a technical review. |

---

## 8.  KPI & Metrics

- **First Response Time** – should be ≤ 24 hours for all warranty inquiries.  
- **Approval to Shipping Time** – Target 7 business days from order creation.  
- **Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)** – Maintain ≥ 90% on warranty repairs.  
- **Warranty Claim Accuracy** – Target 99% correct remedy selection on the first pass.

## 4.  Shipping Decision Flowchart

**A.  Customer asks: “How much will shipping cost?”**
1. Ask for the postal/zip code.
2. Lookup shipping cost in the system:
   - If **domestic address** → Show standard, expedited, or free‑shipping options.
   - If **international address** → Show international rates plus estimated duties.
3. Explain any free‑shipping threshold.
4. Answer the customer’s question and confirm the chosen shipping method.

**B.  Customer asks: “What is the estimated delivery time?”**
1. Identify product tier (domestic vs. international, standard vs. expedited).
2. Provide estimated delivery window:
   - Domestic (standard) → 5–7 business days (including 24‑hr processing).
   - Domestic (expedited) → 1–2 business days.
   - International (standard) → 10–14 business days.
   - International (expedited) → 5–7 business days.

**C.  Customer asks: “I haven’t received my package.”**
1. Verify order number and tracking number.
2. Check tracking status on carrier portal:
   - 🚚 **In transit** → Inform customer the package is on its way.
   - 📦 **Out for delivery** → ETA within same day.
   - ⚠️ **Delayed / Held at carrier** → Contact carrier for details; update customer.
   - ❌ **Lost / Not Delivered / Return‑to‑Sender** → **Follow Lost‑Package Procedure** (see §6).

**D.  Customer wants to change their shipping address.**
1. Confirm the order is still in the “Processing” state (not yet shipped).
2. Verify the new address.
3. Update the address in the order system; notify the customer of any cost change.
4. If the order is already shipped, direct the customer to contact the carrier directly with the new address (provide the carrier’s contact).

**E.  Customer is requesting a shipping fee refund.**
1. Only available if:
   - The order total < free‑shipping threshold,
   - The item is canceled prior to shipment,
   - The item is returned without damage to the customer’s account in the next 7 days.
2. Process the refund via the billing system; inform the customer of refund timeline (5–7 business days).
