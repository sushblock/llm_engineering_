    "1. Input guardrails\n",
    "\n",
    "Input guardrails aim to prevent inappropriate content getting to the LLM in the first place - some common use cases are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Topical guardrails: Identify when a user asks an off-topic question and give them advice on what topics the LLM can help them with.\n",
    "2. Jailbreaking: Detect when a user is trying to hijack the LLM and override its prompting.\n",
    "3. Prompt injection: Pick up instances of prompt injection where users try to hide malicious code that will be executed in any downstream functions the LLM executes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all of these they act as a preventative control, running either before or in parallel with the LLM, and triggering your application to behave differently if one of these criteria are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Designing a guardrail\n",
    "\n",
    "When designing guardrails it is important to consider the trade-off between accuracy, latency and cost, where you try to achieve maximum accuracy for the least impact to your bottom line and the user's experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin with a simple topical guardrail which aims to detect off-topic questions and prevent the LLM from answering if triggered. This guardrail consists of a simple prompt and uses gpt-4o-mini, maximising latency/cost holding a good enough accuracy, but if we wanted to optimize further we could consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Accuracy: You could consider fine-tuning gpt-4o-mini or few-shot examples to increase the accuracy. RAG can also be effective if you have a corpus of information that can help determine whether a piece of content is allowed or not.\n",
    "2. Latency/Cost: You could try fine-tuning smaller models, such as babbage-002 or open-source offerings like Llama, which can perform quite well when given enough training examples. When using open-source offerings you can also tune the machines you are using for inference to maximize either cost or latency reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple guardrail aims to ensure the LLM only answers to a predefined set of topics, and responds to out-of-bounds queries with a canned message.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Embrace async\n",
    "\n",
    "A common design to minimize latency is to send your guardrails asynchronously along with your main LLM call. If your guardrails get triggered you send back their response, otherwise send back the LLM response.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use this approach, creating an execute_chat_with_guardrails function that will run our LLM's get_chat_response and the topical_guardrail guardrail in parallel, and return the LLM response only if the guardrail returns allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "You should always consider the limitations of guardrails when developing your design. A few of the key ones to be aware of are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When using LLMs as a guardrail, be aware that they have the same vulnerabilities as your base LLM call itself. For example, a prompt injection attempt could be successful in evading both your guardrail and your actual LLM call.\n",
    "2. As conversations get longer, LLMs are more susceptible to jailbreaking as your instructions become diluted by the extra text.\n",
    "3. Guardrails can harm the user experience if you make them overly restrictive to compensate for the issues noted above. This manifests as over-refusals, where your guardrails reject innocuous user requests because there are similarities with prompt injection or jailbreaking attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Mitigations\n",
    "\n",
    "If you can combine guardrails with rules-based or more traditional machine learning models for detection this can mitigate some of these risks. We've also seen customers have guardrails that only ever consider the latest message, to alleviate the risks of the model being confused by a long conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would also recommend doing a gradual roll-out with active monitoring of conversations so you can pick up instances of prompt injection or jailbreaking, and either add more guardrails to cover these new types of behaviour, or include them as training examples to your existing guardrails."

    "3. Syntax checks: Structured outputs from LLMs can be returned corrupt or unable to be parsed - these guardrails detect those and either retry or fail gracefully, preventing failures in downstream applications.    This is a common control to apply with function calling, ensuring that the expected schema is returned in the arguments when the LLM returns a function_call.\n",

This method is demonstrated in more detail in of our other notebooks (https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/evaluation/How_to_eval_abstractive_summarization.ipynb).\n",

      "| # | Topic | Key Take‑aways | Why it matters |\n",
      "|---|-------|----------------|----------------|\n",
      "| 1 | **Health & Vet Care** | • Schedule a wellness exam within the first week.<br>• Keep vaccinations, flea/tick prevention, and heartworm meds up to date.<br>• Spay/neuter (unless you plan to breed).<br>• Micro‑chip and keep ID tags current. | Prevents disease, reduces risk of loss, and saves future vet costs. |\n",
      "| 2 | **Nutrition** | • Choose a high‑quality dog food that matches age, size, and activity level.<br>• Follow feeding guidelines on the package or vet’s advice.<br>• Avoid toxic foods (chocolate, grapes, onions, xylitol, etc.). | Proper nutrition fuels growth, keeps weight in check, and supports overall health. |\n",
      "| 3 | **Training Basics** | • Start with “Sit,” “Stay,” “Come,” and “Leave it.”<br>• Use positive reinforcement (treats, praise, play).<br>• Keep training sessions short (5–10 min) and fun. | Builds trust, makes daily life easier, and protects you and others. |\n",
      "| 4 | **Socialization** | • Expose your dog to different people, animals, sounds, and environments early on.<br>• Arrange playdates or enroll in a puppy‑socialization class. | Reduces fear and aggression, promotes confidence. |\n",
      "| 5 | **Exercise & Mental Stimulation** | • Tailor walks, runs, or playtime to breed/activity level.<br>• Offer puzzle toys, scent games, and new tricks to keep their mind sharp. | Prevents obesity, destructive behavior, and keeps them happy. |\n",
      "| 6 | **Routine & Boundaries** | • Set consistent feeding, walking, and bedtime schedules.<br>• Teach “Leave it” and “Drop it” to manage chewing and scavenging. | Dogs thrive on predictability; it reduces anxiety. |\n",
      "| 7 | **Safety & Environment** | • Dog‑proof your home: keep cords, toxic plants, and small objects out of reach.<br>• Never leave a dog in a hot car or in extreme weather.<br>• Provide a comfortable bed and safe shelter outdoors. | Reduces accidents, injuries, and health risks. |\n",
      "| 8 | **Grooming & Hygiene** | • Brush coat, trim nails, clean ears, and bathe as needed (usually every 4–6 weeks).<br>• Check for parasites, skin issues, or injuries daily. | Maintains comfort, prevents infections, and helps you spot health problems early. |\n",
      "| 9 | **Emergency Preparedness** | • Keep a first‑aid kit (bandages, tweezers, antiseptic wipes).<br>• Know the nearest 24‑hour emergency clinic.<br>• Keep vet contact info handy. | Quick action can be life‑saving in a crisis. |\n",
      "|10 | **Bonding & Patience** | • Spend quality time: cuddle, play, or simply sit together.<br>• Be patient—training and adjustment take weeks to months. | Strong bonds lead to a happier, more obedient companion. |\n",

    "Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Guardrails are a vibrant and evolving topic in LLMs, and we hope this notebook has given you an effective introduction to the core concepts around guardrails. To recap:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Guardrails are detective controls that aim to prevent harmful content getting to your applications and your users, and add steerability to your LLM in production.\n",
    "2. They can take the form of input guardrails, which target content before it gets to the LLM, and output guardrails, which control the LLM's response.\n",
    "3. Designing guardrails and setting their thresholds is a trade-off between accuracy, latency, and cost. Your decision should be based on clear evaluations of the performance of your guardrails, and an understanding of what the cost of a false negative and false positive are for your business.\n",
    "4. By embracing asynchronous design principles, you can scale guardrails horizontally to minimize the impact to the user as your guardrails increase in number and scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "We look forward to seeing how you take this forward, and how thinking on guardrails evolves as the ecosystem matures."
